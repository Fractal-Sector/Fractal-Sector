/// pAIs, or Personal AIs, are essentially portable ghost role generators.

/// Theoretically speaking pAIs are supposed to use a dedicated "offer and select" system,
///  with the player holding the pAI being able to choose one of the ghosts in the round.
/// This seems too complicated for an initial implementation, though,
///  and there's not always enough players and ghost roles to justify it.
